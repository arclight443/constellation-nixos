## Post-install Steps

Enable the following systemd service for Chromium PWA support on NixOS. Flake is provided by [Luis-Hebendanz](https://github.com/Luis-Hebendanz/nixos-chrome-pwa)

```bash
systemctl --user enable auto-fix-chrome-pwa.service
```

You will see the following message:

```
The unit files have no installation config (WantedBy=, RequiredBy=, Also=,
Alias= settings in the [Install] section, and DefaultInstance= for template
units). This means they are not meant to be enabled using systemctl.

Possible reasons for having this kind of units are:
• A unit may be statically enabled by being symlinked from another unit's
  .wants/ or .requires/ directory.
• A unit's purpose may be to act as a helper for some other unit which has
  a requirement dependency on it.
• A unit may be started when needed via activation (socket, path, timer,
  D-Bus, udev, scripted systemctl call, ...).
• In case of template units, the unit is meant to be enabled with some
  instance name specified.
```

However you can safely ignore it. The service will start automatically after reboot once enabled, or you can just start it immediately yourself with:

```bash
systemctl --user start auto-fix-chrome-pwa.service
```
